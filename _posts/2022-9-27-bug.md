Today, I tried to use the project [deepfit](https://github.com/sitzikbs/DeepFit), meet lots of bugs...,
for example:
```
[Open Browser Console for more detailed log - Double click to close this message]
Failed to load model class 'FigureModel' from module 'ipyvolume'
makeError@http://localhost:8888/static/components/requirejs/require.js?v=d37b48bb2137faa0ab98157e240c084dd5b1b5e74911723aa1d1f04c928c2a03dedf922d049e4815f7e5a369faa2e6b6a1000aae958b7953b5cc60411154f593:168:17
```
I have no idea what is wrong with the `ipyvolume`, will fix it over?

And also, meet with bad situation with deep learning.

The initial idea was for a function (smooth, yet not trivial in expression, e.g. f = x + exp(x/3) + sin(x)), I will use a deep network with several layers (mlps, as for testing the power of universial approximation of 'mlp'), but then it turns out when the neural net work is complex or the optimizer is bad, the net work will approximate a unimagiable bad result...

And also the neural net work is not working well...
